The data I plan to use is that from my own capstone data set, and that from previous capstone students.
The data includes the number of C. mariae parasites identified in preserved hosts species A. purpurescens, L. pacificus, L. bilineata, and P. vetulus collected from Puget sound between 1886 and 2016.
The main question I would like to adress, is how the parasitic burden on theses hosts has changed from past to present.
To do this, I will create a scatterplot using the point, line, and boxplot geoms in ggplot2 to plot the number of C. mariae parasites identified in hosts against time, with each differently colored line representing a host species.
Additionally, if possible I'll make a map using the lat and long coordinates for each hosts collection location to show all of the locations of collection in Puget sound for all four host species.
