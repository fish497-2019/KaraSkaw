##Concept

Determing how the *Clavinema mariae* burden on definitive host species *Anoplarchus purpurescens*, *Lycodes pacificus*, *Parophyrus vetulus*, and *Lepidopsetta bilineata* in Puget Sound, Washington, has changed from past to present.

In this document I will:

1. Load the csv files containing rawdata for all four defintive host species
2. Use the data to make visualizations and graphs
