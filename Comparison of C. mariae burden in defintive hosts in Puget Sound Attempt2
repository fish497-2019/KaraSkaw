##Concept

Determing how the *Clavinema mariae* burden on definitive host species *Anoplarchus purpurescens*, *Lycodes pacificus*, *Parophyrus vetulus*, and *Lepidopsetta bilineata* in Puget Sound, Washington, has changed from past to present.

In this document I will:

1. Load the csv files containing rawdata for all four defintive host species
2. Use the data to make a scatterplot showing the change in *C. mariae* burden on these four hosts over time
3. Use the data to make a map that plots all of the locations of collection for all four host species

Loading in csv files and assinging them to objects
```{r, cache=TRUE}
#Read in the csv files
#assign the csv files to names
L_bilineata <- read.csv("Davis Lepidepsetta billineata p2.csv")
L_pacificus <- read.csv("karagiri lycodes pacificus.csv")
P_vetulus <- read.csv("Ingrid Porphyrus vetulus.csv")
A_purpurescens <- read.csv("Anoplarchus_purpurescens_spacial_auto_coorelation_fixed_UPDATED_4162019.csv")

```

Week 8 Assingment
```{r}
#Part of this weeks (week 8) assingment is to create a modified table
#however the following modififications are not neccessary for figure ()
library(dplyr)
#Lets say I only wanted to look at hosts that actually had an infection
#I could filter out hosts where C. mariae identified was less than one
L_bilineata_hosts<- filter(L_bilineata, C_mariae_total > 1)
L_pacficus_hosts <- filter(L_pacificus, C_mariae_total > 1)
P_vetulus_hosts <- filter(P_vetulus, C_mariae_total > 1)
A_purpurescens_hosts <- filter(A_purpurescens, C_mariae_total > 1)
```

Generating a plot of *C. mariae* burden vs. year
```{r}
#Now I am making a plot using the orginial raw data files NOT the modified tables I
#made above
#load ggplot
library(ggplot2)
#plot the total C. mariae in host species vs. year
ggplot(mappings = aes(x = year, y = C_mariae_total))+
  geom_point(data = L_bilineata, aes(x = year, y = C_mariae_total), color = "blue")+
  geom_point(data = L_pacificus, aes(x = year, y = C_mariae_total), color = "green")+
  geom_point(data = P_vetulus, aes(x = year, y = C_mariae_total), color = "red")+
  geom_point(data = A_purpurescens, aes(x = year, y = C_mariae_total), color = "orange")+
  labs(x = "Year of host species collection", y = "Number of parasites per host species")
```

Attempts to code a legend for the graph above
```{r}
#These are some of the different types of code that I have tried to use to make a 
#legend showing which color represents which host, but neither have worked

#Attempt #1
legend("left", 
       legend = c("Rock Sole", "Eel pout","English sole","Prickleback"), 
       col = c(rgb(0.2,0.4,0.1,0.7), 
               rgb(0.8,0.4,0.1,0.7)), 
       pch = c(17,19), 
       bty = "n", 
       pt.cex = 2, 
       cex = 1.2, 
       text.col = "black", 
       horiz = F , 
       inset = c(0.1, 0.1))
#Attempt #2  
legend("left", title = "Host Species", legend=c("Rock sole","Eel pout","English sole","Prickleback"),col=palette(10),pch=20,bg="white") 
  
  scale_color_manual(name="Host Species", values=c("blue", "green","red", "orange")) + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 0)))

#Attempt #3
  legend(x = 1910, y = 42, legend, fill = NULL, col = "blue","red","orange","blue")
         border = "black", lty, lwd, pch,
         angle = 45, density = NULL, bty = "o", bg = par("bg"),
         box.lwd = par("lwd"), box.lty = par("lty"), box.col = par("fg"),
         pt.bg = NA, cex = 1, pt.cex = cex, pt.lwd = lwd,
         xjust = 0, yjust = 1, x.intersp = 1, y.intersp = 1,
         adj = c(0, 0.5), text.width = NULL, text.col = par("col"),
         text.font = NULL, merge = do.lines && has.pch, trace = FALSE,
         plot = TRUE, ncol = 1, horiz = FALSE, title = NULL,
         inset = 0, xpd, title.col = text.col, title.adj = 0.5,
         seg.len = 2) 

#Attempt #4
legend <- c("Rock Sole", "English Sole", "High cockscomb prickleback", "Black belly eelpout")
legend(1910, 42= NULL, legend, fill = NULL, col = "blue","red","orange","blue",
       border = "black", lty, lwd, pch,
       angle = 45, density = NULL, bty = "o", bg = par("bg"),
       box.lwd = par("lwd"), box.lty = par("lty"), box.col = par("fg"),
       pt.bg = NA, cex = 1, pt.cex = cex, pt.lwd = lwd,
       xjust = 0, yjust = 1, x.intersp = 1, y.intersp = 1,
       adj = c(0, 0.5), text.width = NULL, text.col = par("col"),
       text.font = NULL, merge = do.lines && has.pch, trace = FALSE,
       plot = TRUE, ncol = 1, horiz = FALSE, title = NULL,
       inset = 0, xpd, title.col = text.col, title.adj = 0.5,
       seg.len = 2)  
```
Also attempting to create a map that plots all of the locations of collection for all four host species.
```{r}
#Making a map of collection sites
#Trying to plot all of the lat and long points for each of the four host species 
library(maps)
library(mapdata)
library(maptools) #for shapefiles
library(scales) #for transparency
map("worldHires","Canada",xlim=c(-127,-121),ylim=c(46,49),col="gray90",fill=TRUE)
map("worldHires","USA",xlim=c(-127,-121),ylim=c(46,49),col="gray90",fill=TRUE,add=TRUE)
#The following line of code is what I am having an issue with 
points(L_bilineata$long,L_bilineata$lat, L_pacificus$long, L_pacificus$lat, P_vetulus$long, P_vetulus$lat, A_purpurescens$long_updated, A_purpurescens$lat_updated, pch=19,col="red",cex=0.5)
box()
library(maps)
map.scale(x=-126.0, y=46.5, rot=0, cex=1)
library(GISTools)
compassRose (x=-125.5, y=47.5, rot=0, cex=1)
map.axes()
```
